# nFucks

A minimal library for updating and drawing terminal-based TUIs and character screens.

Current optimization level: ~absolute crap~ ~tolerable~ ~almost fast enough~ decent

### Capabilities
+ Multiple surface buffer management
+ Basic layouting system
+ Automatic Cell burrow-merge algorithm (cherry pick cells and write to them as if they were a uniform subsurface)
+ Circular/Arc subsurface selection for burrows
+ that's about it
